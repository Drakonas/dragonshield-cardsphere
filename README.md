## This Project <a name = "about"></a>

I really like Dragon Shield's Card Manager and scanner. The insights provided by Dragon Shield are super helpful as well. If you are not familiar with the Dragon Shield App, check it out here: https://www.dragonshield.com/digital-card-manager/

I also have been a huge fan of Cardsphere once I've discovered it. I don't get the chance to go to my LGS and trade frequently, and sometimes we just end up with cards that we really have a hard time trading away. Cardsphere is a web platform that allows users to post their collection for trade while also allowing me to create a wants list to receive cards from other users. Check out cardsphere here: https://www.cardsphere.com/

Recently, I revamped a lot of my decks, created several new decks, and totally disrupted my collection on Cardsphere. So I now have to start over. I used Dragon Shield to scan my binders, but I found that Cardsphere didn't like the CSV format that Dragon Shield exported. With the help of the Cardsphere devs and community, and a useful API tool at https://www.multiversebridge.com/, I was able to convert Dragon Shield's export CSV files to a format that Cardsphere liked.

## Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

You'll need to do a little setup in order to get this project running for the first time. I hope to have executable files in a future update, but I'm not there yet and I want to get this out for people to use.

You'll need Python 3: 

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo.
